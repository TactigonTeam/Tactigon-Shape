# Tactigon Shapes

Tactigon Shapes is an extension of [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly), which is a project by Google and that allows you to create visual, drag-and-drop block-based programming interfaces. Instead of typing code, you can create programs by connecting blocks together. This README provides an overview of the project, its features, installation instructions, and guidance on contributing.
