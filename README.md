# Tactigon Shapes

Tactigon Shapes is an extension of [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly) which is a project by Google and it allows you to create visual, drag-and-drop block-based programming interfaces. Instead of typing code, you can create programs by connecting blocks together. This README provides an overview of the project, its features, installation instructions, and guidance on contributing.

## Introduction
Tactigon Shapes simplifies programming by allowing you to build logic visually instead of writing code. This project is ideal for beginners, educators, and developers who want to create fast prototypes using gesture recognition and voice commands using Tactigon Ecosystem.

## Key Features:
- Visual Programming: Drag-and-drop interface that helps users understand programming concepts.
- Code Generation: Automatically generates code in multiple programming languages.
- Customizable: You can create your own blocks and define their behavior.
  
## Tactigon Ecosystem

Tactigon ecosystem is consists of:
 - [Tactigon Gear](https://pypi.org/project/tactigon-gear/) to connect to a Tactigon Skin wearable device and do gesture recognition
 - [Tactigon Speech](https://pypi.org/project/tactigon-speech/) to implement voice recognition on top of Tactigon Gear
 - [Tactigon Arduino Braccio](https://pypi.org/project/tactigon-arduino-braccio/) to connect to the Arduino Braccio device

## Using Tactigon Shapes

Using Shapes is like building with LEGO bricks, you drag, drop, and connect pieces to create something functional. This section guides you step-by-step on how to use shapes.

Once you are on the Shape interface, you can see some of our example shapes, such as Powerpoint, Braccio voice, and so on. On the left side, you will see all your shapes, and on the right side, you can see the snapshot of your shape.

## How to use Shapes


### Creating a New Shape:
1. Click **Add Shape**.
2. Enter a unique shape name and description.
3. Add the shape to open the editing workspace.
4. Drag blocks from the left pane to the workspace to build your logic.
5. Click **Save** to save your shape.

### Editing an Existing Shape:
1. Select a shape from the homepage.
2. Click **Edit Code** to modify the shape.
3. Save your changes after editing.

Think of blocks like puzzle pieces. This means you can now connect them by dragging one block and placing it under or inside another block. However, ensure that your shapes snap together; otherwise, the program will not execute.

### Run Your First Shape
- When you are done building, click the toggle button to see what your program does.
- You will see a page with both your shape and the terminal with the output.

### Deleting a Shape:
- Click the **bin** icon next to the shape name to delete it.

## Creating Custom Blocks

We'll walk you through how to create the block and handle the Python code generation. The easiest step is to create your custom blocks on the Blockly Developer website:  [Blockly Developer Tools](https://developers.google.com/blockly/guides/create-custom-blocks/blockly-developer-tools). This platform provides an intuitive interface for defining block shapes, fields, and behavior without needing to write code manually. You can customize the block's appearance, input types, and logic connections. Once your block is designed, the tool generates the corresponding JSON, which can be easily integrated into Tactigon Shapes project.

### Steps to Create Custom Blocks:

1. **Create a Category (Optional)**  
   - If you want to organize your blocks, you can create a new category or assign your block to an existing category.  
   - To create a new category, go to the [Edit](https://github.com/TactigonTeam/Tactigon-Shape/blob/master/tactigon_shapes/modules/shapes/templates/shapes/edit.jinja) page in the **Shape** module.

```Html
  <category name="To Uppercase" colour="#f1c40f ">
      <block type="to_uppercase">
      </block>
  </category>
```

2. **Design Your Block**  
   - Use the Blockly Developer Tools to create your new block by customizing its inputs, logic, and appearance.  
   - Once done, copy the generated JSON code for your block.
```javascript
 Blockly.Blocks['to_uppercase'] = {
        init: function () {
            this.jsonInit({
                "type": "to_uppercase",
                "tooltip": "",
                "helpUrl": "",
                "message0": "To Uppercase %1",
                "args0": [
                  {
                    "type": "input_value",
                    "name": "TEXT",
                    "check": "String"
                  }
                ],
                "previousStatement": null,
                "nextStatement": null,
                "colour": '#f1c40f'
              });
        }
};
```

3. **Add the Block to Tactigon Shapes**  
   - Paste the JSON code into the [Custom blocks file](https://github.com/TactigonTeam/Tactigon-Shape/blob/master/tactigon_shapes/modules/shapes/static/js/custom_blocks.js) page in the **Shapes** module.  
   - After adding it, you will see both the new category (if created) and the new block in the Tactigon Shapes workspace.

4. **Write Custom Code for the Block**  
   - You can write custom Python code for your block in the [Custom blocks file](https://github.com/TactigonTeam/Tactigon-Shape/blob/master/tactigon_shapes/modules/shapes/static/js/custom_blocks.js) page in the **Shapes** module.
   - From Tactigon Shapes you can generate code in JavaScript, Python, PHP, or Dart based on the visual blocks. But we recommend using Python because almost all of our projects speak Python. 
```python
    python.pythonGenerator.forBlock['to_uppercase'] = function(block) {
        var text_to_print = Blockly.Python.valueToCode(block, 'TEXT', Blockly.Python.ORDER_ATOMIC) || "''";
        var code = `debug(logging_queue, ${text_to_print}.upper())\n`;
        return code;
    };  
```

5. **Run and Test**  
   - After creating your block, rerun the project and test your block by running your shape.

Here we have attached a demo video about how to create your own block in the Tactigon Shapes project.
